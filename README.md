## Description

GHRepoDeleteHelper is a Tampermonkey script that simplifies the process of deleting repositories on GitHub.

It adds a `ü§ñ Auto Fill` button above the `Delete this repository` button. Clicking this button automatically fills the input box with `<username>/<repo-name>` and activates the `Delete this repository` button below.

The reason for not directly activating the `Delete this repository` button is because I believe this operation is indeed very dangerous. Therefore, think twice before you go, and GitHub does this probably for the same reason.

However, every time I am sure I want to delete a repository, it is cumbersome to copy and paste. Hence, I created this script to save time, hoping it can also be helpful for you.

However, it is very annoying to copy and paste every time I decide to delete a repository. Therefore, I created this script to save time, and I hope it can also be helpful for you.
